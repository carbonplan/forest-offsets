    "- IFM-7: Carbon contained in in-use forest products\n",
    "- IFM-8: Carbon contained in landfilled forest products\n",

    "\n",
    "Means we end up with three \"allocation\" values:\n",

    "- Issuance: the official, issued allocation of ARBOCs as recorded by ARB.\n",
    "- OPDR-Reported: the OPO/APD reported ARBC\n",
