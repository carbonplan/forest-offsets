    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to explore how common practice (CP) relates to ARBOCs. One of the main\n",
    "goals of this _Retrospective_ is to understand how changes in CP translate into changes in ARBOCs.\n",
    "Therefore, we need to work through the math that links CP to Baseline Components (specifically,\n",
    "IFM-1) and, ultimately, ARBOCs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We should start with the actual equation for calculating ARBOCs. If I'd started here myself, I'd\n",
    "have saved myself a fair amount of grief...but hey, that's why we keep notes and do research!\n",
    "\n",
    "ARBOCs are calculated via the following equation: \\begin{align} ARBOC*{RP} & = (\\Delta\n",
    "Project*{onsite} - \\Delta Baseline*{onsite}) + 0.8(Project*{woodProducts, RP} -\n",
    "Baseline*{woodProducts, RP}) + SE*{RP}, \\end{align} where SE stands for secondary effects due to\n",
    "harvesting in the project scenario and RP denotes the reporting period. Furthermore, the onsite\n",
    "carbon pool comprises IFM-1 (standing live) and IFM-3 (standing dead), while the wood products pools\n",
    "are represented by in-use (IFM-7) and landfillled (IFM-8) woodproducts. The calculations for SE are\n",
    "little more complicated and we just end up using the value directly reported in each annual OPDR.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis only concerns the first reporting period, which simplifies things a little bit. Because\n",
    "we're in the first reporting period, there is no \"change\" from previous reporting periods, so both\n",
    "$\\Delta$ terms for onsite carbon pools (IFM-1 \\& IFM-3) simplify to thier initial values:\n",
    "\\begin{align} ARBOC*{RP1} & = (Project*{onsite, RP1} - Baseline*{onsite, RP1}) +\n",
    "0.8(Project*{woodProducts, RP1} - Baseline*{woodProducts, 1}) + SE*{RP1} \\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "We can take this equation one step further by splitting out `initial` carbon from `project` or\n",
    "`growth` carbon. \\begin{align} ARBOC*{RP1} & = ARBOC*{initial} + ARBOC*{growth} \\\\ ARBOC*{growth} &\n",
    "= (Project*{onsite, End} - Project*{onsite, Start}) + 0.8(Project*{woodProducts, RP1} -\n",
    "Baseline*{woodProducts, 1}) + SE*{RP1}\\\\ ARBOC*{initial} & = Project*{onsite, Start} -\n",
    "Baseline*{onsite} \\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Eq. 3 introduces a few new bits of terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the issuance table we get ARBOCs, which we'll denote as $Issuance_{RP1}$ to emphasisze its\n",
    "provenance from official ARB source, so: [not clear if this helps or confuses] \\begin{align}\n",
    "ARBOC*{RP1} & = Issuance*{RP1} \\\\ ARBOC*{initial} & = Issuance*{RP1} - ARBOC\\_{growth} \\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaning if we $Project_{onsite, End}$, $Project_{onsite, Start}$, $Project_{woodProducts, RP1}$,\n",
    "$Baseline_{woodProducts, RP1}$, and $SE_{RP1}$ (Eq. 2b). Thankfully, we get all the terms but\n",
    "$Project_{onsite, Start}$ from annual OPDR. Some projects' OPDRs actually report\n",
    "$Project_{onsite, Start}$ separately, but reporting is mostly inconsistent and we did not end up\n",
    "recording. Looking forward, it should also be possible to figure out the \"growth\" component of IFM-1\n",
    "and IFM-3 by looking across multiple reporting periods. If you just take the average increment in\n",
    "IFM-1 and IFM-3 over a few reporting periods and subtract it from IFM-1 and IFM-3 for RP_1 -- that\n",
    "would be a fairly good estimate of the onsite carbon at the project outset. Unfortuantely, this\n",
    "approach doesn't work either -- because we only entered values for RP_1! If we did have that data\n",
    "(and we might be able to get it from Barbara!), we could simply do:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align} \\Delta Project*{onsite} = Project*{onsite, End} - Project\\_{onsite, Start}, E some\n",
    "notation average delta \\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall, we're just interested in how changes in common practice affect calculations of \"upfront\"\n",
    "carbon. In theory, this should just be the difference between project onsite carbon and baseline\n",
    "onsite carbon, **at the start of the first reporting period**. However, the project values for IFM-1\n",
    "and IFM-3 are reported at the _end of the reporting period_, meaning the reported values represent\n",
    "both the initial standing carbon and the \"growth\" carbon through the end of the first reporting\n",
    "period. Now, there are several ways to get around this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\overline{\\Delta Project_{Onsite}}$ is the mean increment in IFM-1 and IFM-3. (N.B., such an\n",
    "approach would need to make sure to account for varying lengths in reporting periods.) [This math is\n",
    "a little clunky right now but still helpful in thinking things through. It's likely most helpful to\n",
    "rewrite in terms of RP0]\n",
    "\n",
    "For the current iteration, however, we're going to have to estimate $ARBOC_{Upfront}$ from the\n",
    "issuance table. This estimate requires a semi-strong assumption that the growth in IFM-1 and IFM-3,\n",
    "the leakage term (based on woodproducts), and secondary effects (SE) do not change across reporting\n",
    "periods. If we make that assumption, it should be the case that: \\begin{align} ARBOC*{Upfront} & =\n",
    "Issuance*{RP1} - Issuance\\_{RP2} \\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, since we're assuming that $Project_{Onsite, RP1}$ is constant (e.g., it doesn't change in\n",
    "response to changes in the baseline), any change in onsite baseline carbon caused by a change in CP\n",
    "leads directly to a change in $ARBOC_{Upfront}$. The remainder of this notebook explores the logic\n",
    "laid out above and concludes with a general approach for translating from CP to ARBOCs.\n"
