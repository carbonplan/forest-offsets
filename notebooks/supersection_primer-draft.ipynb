    "IFM projects have a unique feature in that they receive an \"upfront\" tranche of offset credits (termed ARBOCs, which stands for ARB offset credits). \n",
    "Though the precise calculation is somewhat involved, in practice the calculation hinges on two numbers: initial carbon stock (ICS) and common practice (CP). \n",
    "This document explains how CP is derived. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How is common practice calculated? \n",
    "ARB provides a pre-generated look-up table of common practice values. \n",
    "Ultimately, common practice links back to per-tree esitmates of carbon storage, as estimated from Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data. \n",
    "However, for purposes of gaining a stronger intutition about how IFM projects are assigned common practice, we'll treat the ARB provided common practice values as a given. \n",
    "\n",
    "Determining per project common practice requires three pieces of information: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine the *geographic* \"supersection(s)\" where the project falls.\n",
    "2. Within each supersection, stratify forested land within the project by assessment area (forest type).\n",
    "3. Within each assessment area, further stratify by \"site class\" (three choices: low, high, all) \n",
    "\n",
    "With these three pieces of information, a project owner or developer can then use the ARB provided common practice lookup table to calculate area weighted common practice. \n",
