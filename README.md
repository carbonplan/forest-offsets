This repository includes our libraries and scripts for analyzing California's compliance forest carbon offsets program. This work is described in more detail in a [web article](https://carbonplan.org/research/forest-offsets-explainer) and a [preprint](https://carbonplan.org/research/forest-offsets-explainer). See the [carbonplan/forest-offsets-paper](https://github.com/carbonplan/forest-offsets-paper) repository for Jupyter notebooks that specifically recreate all the figures in the preprint. You can also browse some of these data and results in an [interactive web map](https://carbonplan.org/research/forest-offsets).
